The political-security impossibility of realizing it was a starting point, which led to the creation of a zip-line between my fantasy and reality.</p>
<p>The creation process began with a search for overt and covert political strata that existed in the area of ​​Mount Scopus, which were hybridized with key elements that existed in my house. The most significant merger in the work takes place between the typographical decomposition of the area and its distortion in relation to the act of removing the double-bed from the house and replacing it with the model.</p>
<p>Isolating the power mechanisms from the field and casting them into the house revealed different forms <em>to/as</em> one essence. An essence that is based here on practices of repression and evacuation, and there on gentrification and deportation, where in both cases there exists an imaginary border that doesn't allow fluidity between two cultures.</p>
<p>Moving out of the house and into the public space in Florentine <em>enabled another hybridization to take place, which this time fluctuates between</em> evacuating residents from Issawiya and al-Tur to build a national park, which would function as a barrier between them, and between the graffiti tours that take place in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>The work deals with an attempt to blur the boundary between a moment of art <em>and the being</em> of creation and life, while striving to give consideration to the moment when the model will disconnect from life at home and its integration into conditions that will allow him an autonomous life of his own.</p>
