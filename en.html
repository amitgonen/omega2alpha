The political-security impossibility of maintaining it was a starting point, and led to the creation of an Omega between my fantasy and reality.</p>
<p>The process of creation began with the search for overt and covert political strata that existed in the area of ​​Mount Scopus, which were hybridized with key elements that existed in my home. The most significant merger in the work takes place between the typographical decomposition of the area and its distortion in relation to the act of removing the double bed from the house and replacing it with the model.</p>
<p>The isolation of the power mechanisms from the field and their casting into the house revealed different forms to one essence. The essence here is based on the practices of repression and evacuation, and here on gender and expulsion, where in both cases there exists an imaginary limit that does not allow for the flow of two cultures.</p>
<p>The move out of the house to the public space in Florentine enabled another war to take place, this time moving between evacuating residents from Issawiya and al-Tur to build a national park that would function as a barrier between their sons and the graffiti tours that take place in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>The work deals with an attempt to blur the boundary between a moment of art and the creation and life, while striving to give consideration to the moment when the model will disconnect from life at home and its integration under conditions that will allow him autonomous life of his own.</p>
